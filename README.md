Join us for a hands-on workshop using the {fs} package to easily bring order to messy file systems. Through practical examples, you’ll learn to automate common tasks like creating, renaming, moving, and deleting files and directories. Together, we’ll transform a cluttered folder filled with mixed-case filenames and inconsistent delimiters into a clean, organized structure. By the end, you’ll have practical, reusable tools to streamline file management in your own projects.
